## Usage

### Individual config

1. Search for **@BotFather** in Telegram, create a bot, and copy your API Token.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open `.env.example` and fill it as follows:

```
BOT_API_KEY: Your API Token for the bot

REDIS_USER: Username
REDIS_PASSWORD: Password
REDIS_HOST: IP of your PC in your network, e.g., 172.0.0.12 or 192.168.1.2
REDIS_PORT: Port for Redis, default = 6379

POSTGRES_USER: Username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: Password
POSTGRES_HOST: IP of your PC in your network, e.g., 172.0.0.12 or 192.168.1.2
POSTGRES_PORT: Port for PostgreSQL, default = 5432
POSTGRES_DB: Database name

RATE_LIMITING_PERIOD: How many seconds should be monitored
MESSAGES_PER_PERIOD: How many messages a user is allowed to send during the rate-limiting period
```

4. Rename the file to `.env`.
5. Open `redis.conf.example` and fill it as follows:

```
user {REDIS_USER from .env} on >{REDIS_PASSWORD from .env} {allowed commands, default - allcomands} {allowed commands, default - allkeys}
```

so that looks like: `user redis_usr on >my_strong_password allcommands allkeys`.

6. Rename the file to `redis.conf`.

### Run with Docker Compose

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the project's `docker-compose.yaml` is located.
2. Execute: `docker compose build`
3. Execute `docker compose up -d`

### Ready to play

Now open Telegram, start your bot, and have a nice game!

### Stopping an app
